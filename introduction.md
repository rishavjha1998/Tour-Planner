This Project aims to build a Trip Planner Agent which can plan a trip based on the Budget, Location,
Stay and Personalized choices:
1. Stay
2. Travel -- By air or train
3. No of Days
4. No of Persons
5. Preferences

This idea sparks from the core: That whenever we visit any places we generally do things on the fly that results
into extra expense at the same time not even fullfillment of exploration. To avoid your being your trip a headache
beforehand this serves as guide that we can trust & enjoy our journey rather than peeking each time bw expense and 
activites. 

There is always a optimal way to be in between expense & Exploration.
